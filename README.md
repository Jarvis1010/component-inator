component-inator
=========

  Simple tool to build a react-component skeleton.  It accepts two arguments: The Component name and the path where you want the component skeleton to be created.  The second argument must be a relative path from the directory it is running in. If the second argument is omitted, it will default to ./src/app/components/ 

  The Skeleton assumes that you are using the @kadira/storybook module and creates storybook.js files needed for it.
